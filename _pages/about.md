Hi, thanks for stopping by my page. I am from [Macau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macau) and my name is Hou-Wan Long (龍浩雲). I am currently a third year student at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), majoring in Risk Management Science (STAT+CS+FIN, has little thing to do with Management!!). My research interests include Computational Social Science, AI for Finance and Decentralized Mechanism. I am looking for PhD position for Fall, 2026. You can find my [CV](images/resume.pdf) here.
